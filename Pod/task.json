troubleshoot and correct the issues with the pod

you must exec into the pod to show what's

Hint:
alias k=kubectl
export do="- - dry-run=client -o yaml"

# Image Pull Errors
$ k describe pod  web-pod -n dev
$ k logs web-pod -n dev
$ k get events 

# Solution:
Delete the resource
$ k get pods -n dev
No resources found in dev namespace.
Edit the pod.yaml to correct the image name which
was misspelled. Then, reissue the apply command:
$ k apply -f pod.yaml
Pod was successfully created. 
# To Clean up:
$ k delete -f pod.yaml -n dev
